# Assignment 2 Analysis - Steven Petrik

## Algorithm 1

Big-Oh Analysis: O(N^2) because the functions algorithm contains a loop in a loop
Run times:
- 5000: 0.16 seconds
- 10000: 0.53 seconds
- 20000: 2.21 seconds
- 40000: 11.16 seconds
Final Analysis: The function followed the O(N^2) prediction since the output time roughly followed the increase by a factor of 4 each time the input was doubled.

## Algorithm 2

Big-Oh Analysis: O(N) because the algorithm contains one loop
Run times: 
- 100000: 0.02 seconds
- 200000: 0.04 seconds
- 400000: 0.08 seconds
- 800000: 0.16 seconds
- 1600000: 0.33 seconds
- 3200000: 0.75 seconds
- 6400000: 1.72 seconds
Final Analysis: The function followed the O(N) prediction since the output time roughly doubled each time the input was doubled.

## Algorithm 3

Big-Oh Analysis:O(N) because the algorithm contains one loop
Run times:
- 500000: 0.01 seconds
- 1000000: 0.02 seconds
- 2000000: 0.04 seconds
- 4000000: 0.07 seconds
- 8000000: 0.16 seconds
- 16000000: 0.58 seconds
- 32000000: 1.58 seconds
Final Analysis: The function followed the O(N) prediction since the output time roughly doubled each time the input was doubled.
